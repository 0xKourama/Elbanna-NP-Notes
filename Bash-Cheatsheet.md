| !EXPRESSION | The EXPRESSION is false. |
| -n | STRING STRING length is greater than zero |
| -z | STRING The length of STRING is zero (empty) |
| STRING1 != STRING2 | STRING1 is not equal to STRING2 |
| STRING1 = STRING2 | STRING1 is equal to STRING2 |
| INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2 | INTEGER1 is equal to INTEGER2 |
| INTEGER1 -ne INTEGER2 | INTEGER1 is not equal to INTEGER2 |
| INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2 | INTEGER1 is greater than INTEGER2 |
| INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2 | INTEGER1 is less than INTEGER2 |
| INTEGER1 -ge INTEGER2 | INTEGER1 is greater than or equal to INTEGER 2 |
| INTEGER1 -le INTEGER2 | INTEGER1 is less than or equal to INTEGER 2 |

## boolean operators

```bash
read -p "Enter a username: " user
grep $user /etc/passwd && echo "$user found!" || echo "$user not found
```

---

## for loops
```bash
for ip in $(seq 1 254); do echo 10.10.10.$ip; done
```
**OR**
```bash
for ip in {1..254}; do echo 10.10.10.$ip; done
```

---

## while loops

```bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -lt 10 ]
do
	echo "10.10.10.$counter"
	((counter++))
done
```

---

## functions
### normal function declaration and call
```bash
get_a_random_number() {
	echo $RANDOM	
}
get_a_random_number
```
### function with a return value
```bash
return_a_random_number() {
	return $RANDOM	
}
return_a_random_number
echo "return value: $?"
```
### output:
```bash
./func.sh 
return value: 11
```
