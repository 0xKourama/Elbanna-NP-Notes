# what's the situation?
1. am not able to deliver a quality level of cybersecurity work

# what's causing this?
1. constantly receiving tasks from tawfik that do not follow any risk management framework.

# what's the importance of a risk management framework?
1. In cybersecurity, work is prioritized based on risk (the hight risk takes highest priority and gets done first)

# what's stopping tawfik from correctly assessing risk?
1. having very small knowledge of hacking methodologies (no practical hacking experience)
2. lack of vision of what a hacker can do (thinking it's all stuff in the movies ... or for show)
3. him having unrealistic expectations of what I can do ... when I didn't hack into the company ... I became a failure to him and so did cybersecurity (he was let down)
4. him underestimating cybersecurity as a whole
5. ego and being happy with his firewalls
6. acknowledging my attack offends his protections

# what's the fix for this?
1. me sticking to my job profile and working according to risk methodology guidelines and best practices.
2. me reporting directly to you if possible (I don't know what's preventing tawfik from seeing my point of view).
3. with every step, you would receive a presentation from me with any proposal.

# what should you expect from me?
1. feedback with my daily progress

# what is an alternative path?
1. hiring a risk analyst as my supervisor would improve the security posture drastically in the organization

# what is your plan?
1. [identify] regathering all company assets and documenting them
2. [identify] finding the points of highest risk and prioritizing them
3. [protect] securing every point of entry into the network
4. [protect] securing our web applications while working with developers team
5. [protect] securing every critical components interal to the network using best practices
6. [protect] securing the the network itself from network attacks
7. [protect] securing our services from denial of service attacks
8. [protect] hardening internal networks hosts
9. [protect] mitigating any vulnerabilities inside the network
10. [protect] implementing solutions for MFA within the company
11. [protect] working on achieving compliance with world standards (NIST, ISO/IEC 27001 & GDPR)
12. [protect] delivering constant security awarness training to company employees and showing the importance of cybersecurity
12. [detect] work on impelementing detection mechanisms using powershell for standard attack regarind active directory
13. [detect] work on impelementing a SOC environment
14. [respond] work on developing emergency drills and study incident response
15. [recover] work on making sure the recovery process is healthy and good to go

*working on building a complete cybersecurity infrastructure & team using best practices*

# what makes me capable of doing so?
1. leadership and ownership of the situation + good presentation skills
2. engineering background
3. expertise in my field (2K+ hours, Worldwide course done, 200+ machines hacked)
3. highly technical skills
