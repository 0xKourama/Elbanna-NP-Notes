```
# what makes a vulnerability?
1. program
2. credentials
3. information leak

---

# what would make the training good?
1. people gaining something that would benefit the company (why not benefit them as well)?
2. learning something interesting
3. nice way of delivery
4. knowing what to do next

---

# what programs can cause a probability?
1. web application
2. browser
3. application
4. e-mail
5. predictable/reused/easy password

---

# what are elements for security awareness training?
1. fishy applications
2. cracked applications
3. weird (out-of-date) browsers
4. web application attack demonstration
```
# Security Awareness Training:

# what is the purpose of the session?
1. increasing security awareness for personal and company use
2. increasing company security
3. eliminate easy ways for an attacker to gain access

---

# what makes us a valuable target?
1. we hold data of maaaaaany clients (email, vms)
2. emails of many clients could mean compromise of the clients systems
3. hacking us means having ways to hack 200+ clients and possible extend to worldwide branches laterally

---

# what is the most simple and effective step we can take to improve our defense?
1. improving password security

---

# what are the statistics?
1. 51% reuse passwords across their business and personal accounts
2. 67% do not use any form of two-factor authentication in their personal life, and 55% do not use it at work
3. 57% expressed a preference for a login method that does not involve the use of passwords

---

# what would give an attacker access to your passwords?
1. malicious links (clicking on ads, scareware, suspicious emails)
2. Insecure websites = access to your browser and the passwords it contains
3. Software from untrusted sources on your computer, tablet or phone

---

# passwords
## what's the callenge with passwords?
1. a long unpredictable complex password is not something you can remember > finding an unpredictable place for your passwords is the way to counter this
2. one password for everything is not the way to go

---

## what makes password-based attacks so powerful?
1. makes an attacker login in an authorized way (you enter the house from the main door)
2. doesn't matter how secure a system is once a password is taken
3. a password is the most basic form of security

---

## what is an attacker doing?
1. getting all employee names and collecting as much personal data about them to be used to generate usernames & passwords
2. looking for all ways to access a network and applying those passwords to them using different techniques

---

## what are the ways a password can be exploited?
###	methods of trying passwords:
1. brute force
2. password spraying

---

###	password list generation:
1. common passwords (password lists)
2. pattern guessing
3. personal-data-based guessing (using birthdays, phone numbers, son/daughter names, nicknames and combinations of them)
4. personal password reuse
5. using letter translation methods for predictable passwords (using @ instead of A, $ intead of S)

---

## what is a good password criteria?
1. long and simple vs. short and complex
2. easy to remember and hard to guess
3. stay away from variations of the word password (ex: P@$$w0rD)
4. rotation (only useful if you're going to make a considerable change) (adding 1 or 123 at the end doesn't count)

---

## what can you do to generate & test your password strength?
https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator

---

## what can be done to resolve this?
1. Multi-Factor Authentication whenever you can (this adds an easy layer of protection)
	- What can you do to apply MFA?
	every modern platform has multi-factor authentication (it would probably be around the Account Settings Area)
2. generate unique passwords (reusing passwords enables an attacker to have access to more resources with the same data)
3. generate complex passwords
4. A long simple password might work just fine if you want to have a memorable password

---

## what's a good place to store passwords?
1. A password manager (lastpass, dashlane)
2. Uncommon areas (avoiding common areas like (desktop, downloads, documents ..etc. is a good practice))
3. Uncommon names for the credentials file (naming the file 'passwords.txt or credentials.csv' is good to express the purpose ... but also makes things easy for the attacker)
4. Google chrome (best for browser-based applications)
5. Using a physical item to store passwords will limit the password access to people with physical access

---

## what's the benefit of using a password manager?
1. just one master password to remember or keep
2. freedom to generate and use complex passwords

---

## what would stop a hacker after he has got your password?
1. MFA (what's good about it? 1. easy to implement)
2. Access list (trusted devices)
3. password rotation (a hacker needs time to be able to put your password to use)

---

## what would you gain with improving password security?
1. safety (your bank accounts, personal information & other important data would safer)
