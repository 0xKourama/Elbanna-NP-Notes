# reasons the network team might be pissed:
1. isolation of departments into network and security as separate entities > Message delivered: you should at stay in your lane and not hop onto the security wagon > correct information to be delivered: network security is just one branch of security.
2. information security and penetration testing venture into the realm of coding which isn't loved that much by network admins.
3. confidence that the security they apply is enough and there's no chance of attack.
4. understanding that penetration testing is a battle to prove that they suck at their work instead of a threat simulation.
