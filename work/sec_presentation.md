# The purpose of the session
1. Showing the importance of security
2. Increasing `overall awareness` of our security situation
3. `Increasing motivation` for improving security in the organization
4. `Removing the easy ways` a hacker can compromise our network through personal accounts

*Attention and diligence is what we can do to improve our safety*

# What makes WorldPosta a valuable target for hackers?
1. `data of 200+ clients` presents a chance for hackers to make `millions of dollars`
2. a group hackers `wouldn't mind investing a year in hacking us` (hacking 200 companies in a single go isn't a waste of time at all)

*it's not a bad idea for hacker to want to get us*

# What would happen if we got hacked?
1. many `clients' data and business could be at risk`
2. many people could `lose their jobs` if the attack was successful
3. many `lawsuits could be raised` against us if the cause of breach was from our end

*putting such important data at risk could have major consequences*

# What would get us hacked?
1. Being `unaware of magnitude of the threat`
2. Taking security lightly
3. Valuing `convenience over safety` (leaving your house's door is convenient but you will get robbed for sure)
4. Putting `all security responibility on the shoulders of the Security team` ... `Collaboration is the way to go`

# The `first thing` an attacker tries and the various techniques of passwords attacks

*looking for ways to log in and gain access*

1. Trying `common passwords` (summer2021)
2. Guessing passwords using personal data from employee social media
3. Guessing passwords based on company name (any password including Roaya/WorldPosta)
4. Applying the credentials to any available login form

# The statistics worldwide regarding passwords
1. 51% `reuse passwords` across their `business` and `personal` accounts
2. 67% do not use `any form of two-factor authentication` in their personal life, and 55% do not use it at work

*this makes passwords attacks the easiest and simplest way to gain access*

*what's good .... is that fixing this is also easy and simple*

# The `most simple and effective step` we can take to improve our defense
1. Having *good password hygeine*
2. Having `multiple factors` to verify our identity (MFA)

# The challenge with passwords and what makes a good one
`the challenge is remembering/storing a set of good passwords`
1. long
2. complex
3. unique
4. unpredictable

*what we need is a safe way to store many strong passwords*

# Password Managers: what makes managing many strong passwords simpler & easier
1. Having a master password for `all your strong passwords`

# what makes you trust password manager companies?
1. zero-knowledge model: they don't know your passwords
2. two-step verification is required for all employees inside
3. white-hat hackers are continously testing the application for vulnerabilities to improve their security
4. a very elite group of hackers would need significant effort and help from the inside to accomplish such task

# what can keep us safe in the chance they got hacked?
1. Not that easy, In case of a breach, lastPass has teams for incident response ready to act immediately
2. you would know from the news
3. you would have `enough time to change your passwords` in that scenario

# What would stop/slow down a hacker if he has gotten your password?
1. Multi-factor authentication
2. Routine password changes for high-value credentials (a bank safe's password gets changed daily)

# What would you and I gain with improving password security?
1. job safety (your company's loss = your loss)
2. personal account safety
	1. facebook hacked = extortion
	2. bank account hacked = bankrupcy

# That being said, what can we do to get started?
1. in your weekend, `taking some time to change your passwords` wouldn't hurt (one month = all your passwords changed)
2. `enabling MFA` is usually `very easy` as answering a text containing a verification code

`getting used to a good authentication strategy only requires time`

# what are your concerns? what still requires clarification?
# what have you learned from the session? what would be your next step?
