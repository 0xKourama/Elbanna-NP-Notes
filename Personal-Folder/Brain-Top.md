Hello Gavin,

Hope you're doing great.

Yes, I'm interested and would like to know more.

Here's my CV.

*attaches CV*

I want to inform you that I currently live in Cairo, Egypt.
I would have more questions of course if my work would require relocation and/or special paperwork.
It would be a totally new experience for me either way. Since I've never worked abroad :)
