*the answers you get depend on the questions you ask*

# Closed questions (aka the ‘Polar’ question)
## Closed,
- *OR* ‘polar’ questions generally invite a one-word answer,
- such as ‘yes’ *OR* ‘no’.
## For example,
- ‘do you drive?’ or,
- ‘did you take my pen?’ They could also include answers to factual *OR* multiple choice questions,
- such as ‘what’s your name’,
- *OR* ‘would you like tea,
- coffee,
- *OR* water?’

## They’re popular as icebreaker questions in group situations because they’re easy to answer.
## Of course,
- most questions *CAN* be opened up for further discussion,
- including closed questions — *BUT* more on that later.

## Useful for: warming up group discussions,
- getting a quick answer

# Open questions

## Open-ended questions require a little more thought *AND* generally encourage wider discussion *AND* elaboration.
## They can’t be answered with a simple yes *OR* no response.
## For example: ‘what do you think of your boss?’ *OR* ‘why did you choose that car?’

## Useful for: critical *OR* creative discussion,
- finding out more information about a person *OR* subject

----------------------------------------------------

# Probing questions

## These questions are useful for gaining clarification *AND* encouraging others to tell you more information about a subject.
## Probing questions are usually a series of questions that dig deeper *AND* provide a fuller picture.
## For example: ‘*WHEN* do you need the finished project,
- *AND* is it ok *IF* I email it to you?’

## Useful for: seeing the bigger picture,
- encouraging a reluctant speaker to tell you more information,
- *AND* avoiding misunderstandings

----------------------------------------------------

# Leading questions

## These questions are designed to lead the respondent towards a certain desired positive *OR* negative route.

## In the workplace,
- you might encounter leading questions such as: ‘do you have any issues with the project?’,
- *OR* ‘did you enjoy working on that project?’ The former subtly prompts the respondent towards a negative response --> the latter towards a positive.
## Asking ‘how did you get on with that project’ will get you a more balanced answer.

## Leading questions could also involve an appeal at the end that’s designed to coerce the respondent into agreeing with the speaker.
## For example,
- ‘this project is going well,
- isn’t it?’ encourages the respondent to say ‘yes’.
## This works particularly well because psychologically,
- we prefer saying yes over no.
## So *WHEN* we’re put on the spot,
- we’ll usually opt for the former.

## Useful for: building positive discussions,
- closing a sale,
- steering a conversation towards an outcome that serves your interest

## A word of warning: It’s important to use leading questions carefully --> they *CAN* be seen as an unfair way of getting the answer you want.

# Loaded questions

## Loaded questions are seemingly straightforward,
- closed questions — with a twist: they contain an assumption about the respondent.
## They’re famously used *BY* lawyers *AND* journalists to trick their interviewee into admitting a fundamental truth they would otherwise be unwilling to disclose.

## For example,
- the question: ‘have you stopped stealing pens?’ assumes the respondent stole a pen more than once.
## Whether she answers yes *OR* no,
- she will admit to having stolen pens at some point.

## Of course,
- the preferred response would be: ‘I have never stolen a pen in my life’ *BUT* it’s *NOT* *ALWAYS* easy to spot the trap.
## These questions are quite rightly seen as manipulative.

## Useful for: discovering facts about someone who would otherwise be reluctant to offer up the information

----------------------------------------------------

# Funnel questions

## As with a funnel,
- these questions begin broadly before narrowing to a specific point — *OR* vice versa.

## *WHEN* meeting someone new,
- we usually begin with specific,
- closed questions,
- such as ‘what’s your name?’ *AND* ‘what do you do?’ – before broadening out into more open-ended questions,
- such as ‘why did you choose to be a firefighter?’ as you become more comfortable talking to each other.

## The reverse — beginning with a broad question before honing in on something specific — is often used *WHEN* questioning witnesses to gain the maximum amount of information about a person *OR* situation.
## For example,
- ‘what do you do for a living? Do you work nights? Did you see a break-in? Was there more than one person?’ *AND* so on.

## Funnel questions *CAN* also be used to diffuse tension: asking someone to go into detail about their issue distracts them from their anger *AND* gives you the information you need to offer them a solution,
- *WHICH* in turn calms them down *AND* makes them think something positive is being done to help them.

## Useful for: building relationships,
- discovering very specific information,
- diffusing arguments

### what areas made your mind wander? what areas you didn't understand?

----------------------------------------------------

# Recall and process questions

## Recall questions require the recipient to remember a fact.
## For example,
- ‘what’s seven times seven?’ *AND* ‘where did you put the keys?’ *OR* ‘What’s your login password?’ Process questions,
- on the other hand,
- require the respondent to add their own opinion to their answer.
## These types of questions *CAN* be used to test the respondent’s depth of knowledge about a particular topic.
## For example: ‘what are the advantages of asking a closed question?’ *OR* ‘why are you the right person to lead this project?’

## Useful for: encouraging critical thought *AND* in-depth evaluation of a subject in tests,
- interviews *OR* discussions

### what areas made your mind wander? what areas you didn't understand?

----------------------------------------------------

# Rhetorical questions

## These are a different beast altogether because they don’t really require an answer.
## They’re simply statements phrased as questions to make the conversation more engaging for the listener,
- who is drawn into agreeing with you.

## For example,
- ‘isn’t it nice working with such a friendly team?’ is more engaging that ‘this team is friendly’,
- *WHICH* doesn’t require any mental participation from the respondent.

## Rhetorical questions are often used *BY* coaches *OR* public speakers for effect to get the audience thinking *AND* agreeing.
## In this way,
- they’re a not-too-distant cousin of the leading question.

## Useful for: persuading people,
- building engagement

# A word on tone

## Tone,
- context,
- intonation,
- *AND* body language *ALL* help us make sense of what is being asked of us.
## *BUT* what happens *WHEN* you throw technology into the mix *AND* place a digital screen <- *BETWEEN* -> the interlocutors?

## Emojis *AND* gifs have made their way into the workplace,
- *AND* they’re here to stay.
## Moreover,
- there’s no denying that they enhance interpersonal communication *AND* go some way towards fulfilling our need for something a little more human.

## In fact,
- *WHEN* used well,
- emojis *AND* gifs *CAN* make workplace communication a little more fun for everyone.
## *WHEN* asking questions over email,
- *OR* via a team chat app such as Typetalk,
- why *NOT* enhance your message with a g*IF* *OR* two? Obviously,
- use a little discretion — you may want to hold back *WHEN* talking to a new client.
## *BUT* for general chat *AND* team collaboration at work,
- it’s the next best thing to talking face-to-face.

## With a certain level of carefulness towards tone *AND* a knowledge of how to ask questions in the right way,
- you *CAN* get a lot more out of your work relationship.
