$DebugPreference
Determines how PowerShell responds to debugging messages generated by a script, cmdlet or provider, or by a Write-Debug command at the command line.

Some cmdlets display debugging messages, which are typically technical messages designed for programmers and technical support professionals. By default, debugging messages aren't displayed, but you can display debugging messages by changing the value of $DebugPreference.

You can use the Debug common parameter of a cmdlet to display or hide the debugging messages for a specific command. For more information, see about_CommonParameters.

The valid values are as follows:

Stop: Displays the debug message and stops executing. Writes an error to the console.
Inquire: Displays the debug message and asks you whether you want to continue. Adding the Debug common parameter to a command, when the command is configured to generate a debugging message, changes the value of the $DebugPreference variable to Inquire.
Continue: Displays the debug message and continues with execution.
SilentlyContinue: (Default) No effect. The debug message isn't displayed and execution continues without interruption.
