## SNMP Pentest story
```
Several years ago,
	we performed an internal penetration test on a company that provided network integration services to a large number of corporate clients, banks, and other similar organizations.
After several hours of scoping out the system,
	we discovered a large class B network with thousands of attached Cisco routers.
It was explained to us that each of these routers was a gateway to one of their clients, used for management and configuration purposes.
A quick scan for default cisco / cisco telnet credentials discovered a single low-end Cisco ADSL router.
Digging a bit further revealed a set of complex SNMP public and private community strings in the router configuration file.
As it turned out,
	these same public and private community strings were used on every single networking device, for the whole class B range, and beyond
simple management, right?
An interesting thing about enterprise routing hardware is that these devices often support configuration file read and write through private SNMP community string access.
Since the private community strings for all the gateway routers were now known to us,
	by writing a simple script to copy all the router configurations on that network using SNMP and TFTP protocols,
		we not only compromised the infrastructure of the entire network integration company,
			but the infrastructure of their clients, as well.
