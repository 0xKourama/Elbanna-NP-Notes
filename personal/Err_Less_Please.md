# Questions:
1. what turns an idea into a belief?

# Preface:
To human is to err. What a statement!
you mean that just because I'm human, I have to live with the fact that I'm going to be making mistakes all my life?
Such an inconvenience!
What if ... I'm not okay with that?
If we didn't make so many mistakes, Our lives would probably be way smoother.
What if ... one day, humans develop a method of thinking to limit the number of mistakes they made?
What would life be like then?
Would it be better?
Would it be boring?

I guess we should probably find that method first. we can choose to make mistakes afterwards if life gets too boring :D

I'm writing this book because I believe that making mistakes has has brought me a lot of pain in my life. Pain and mistakes are great teachers. But I believe that what I need to learn from my mistakes and pain, are the deeper lessons that lie beneath. The hidden forces at work that drive us to make mistakes. What are these forces and how can we limit their effect.

What i'm searching for is the flaws that are inherent to our design as human beings and what can be done to manage them.

If you haven't figured it out by now, I happen to be nastiest type of perfectionist that is. The guy who's just not having it when it comes to making mistakes. So follow me in my quest to make perfection happen.

I share with you what I believe are the biggest contributors to human error. These are going to be the titles and we're going to talk about each in detail in his own chapter.

1. Thinking you know the nature of something (Not questioning what you believe are truths)
2. Having no patience (jumping to conclusions). choosing speed over accuracy.
3. Assuming
4. What lies outside your awareness
5. Lumping together what needs to be separated (lacking precision)
6. Being biased towards yourself instead of dealing with truths
7. not putting enough focus
8. not asking the right questions
9. not counting all elements of the equation (miscalculations)
10. not collecting enough information (not enough probing) (not enough experimenting) (not enough observation)
11. not having the correct relationships between things (misunderstanding) (not knowing the dependencies)
12. not having enough vocabulary to address/describe complex objects and relationships
13. not performing proper (deep) analysis
14. not having enough knowledge of yourself
15. limiting the number of angles you look at the situation from (having limited perspective)
16. not taking change and variables into consideration
17. ignoring pieces of the puzzle.
18. letting emotions stir you up
19. lack of proper simulation
20. having incorrect definitions of things
21. the "switch to the exact opposite" pattern

now that we've talked about the causes of errors. let's talk about what you can do to limit your mistakes. the process takes time of course. But this deliberate methodical way of breaking down things and closely inspecting the intricate relationships between them has a nice payoff if you're like me and you enjoy the beauty of perfection and care not about the effort spent chasing after it. Oh, I could talk all day about how I love what's flawless. it's just so ... satisfying. Ahem, anyway, let's get back to what we were saying. Yes, here we go:

1. Turn all your knowledge into sentences by writing them down. Having the information jumping around your head is not the way to go.
2. scrutinize each peice of knowledge you have down to the very buttom. any incorrect base can easily bring all your built conclusions to the ground. revise all your definitions. a wrongly defined object will cause a lot of errors in the thinking process.
3. build your conclusions on solid non negotiable non deniable truths.
4. ask yourself what dependencies are required for each statement of yours to be true. many things are only true given a certain condition.
5. remove all bias from the situation, a biased statement is extremely dangerous.
6. break things down. each object is composed of smaller ones that have a level of detail to them. be precise and surgical.
7. probe, experiment and observe. collect as much information as you can. be creative in this because knowing the nature and reality of something needs that investment.
8. don't limit your view, another set of eyes can be of great help. Having a big body of knowledge to draw from is always better.
9. take change into consideration. it's the nature of things to be in constant change. being static is not the way to go.
10. know yourself. knowing your own unique pitfalls is important to curb those unique traits that make you more error prone.
11. ask the right questions
12. collecting all the pieces of the puzzle. for something to happen, many conditions have to be there. if you can list all of them. then you know what work you need to do to guarantee the desired outcome.
13. diffusing and dissecting all emotions and extracting whatever information/conclusions they hold
14. having a correct definition of thing

because reality has too many dimensions, it requires breakdown into its layers.
in order to capture reality, you have to add up all the dimensions to get the truth.
for example, the human body, has so many systems. in order to properly describe a human. you have to describe every system on a high and low level and break it down into its smallest particles.

because perfection is usually reached through the repeated learning from our mistakes.
We accumulate the correct body of knowledge after making enough mistakes.
So in essence, if we have the correct knowledge beforehand, we wouldn't be making mistakes.
And this opens up the questions of:
1. what is knowledge?
2. what can be done to assure we have the correct knowledge?
3. what are the ways to go about collecting information that we can use to increase our chances of success?

# 1. Knowledge
Defined as:
1. the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience or association
2. acquaintance with or understanding of a science, art, or technique
3. the fact or condition of being aware of something
4. the range of one's information or understanding

# 2. Understanding
1. the knowledge and ability to judge a particular situation or subject
2. the capacity to apprehend general relations of particulars
3. the power to make experience intelligible by applying concepts and categories
4. the act or action of grasping with the intellect

# 3. Articulation (Expression)
1. the act of giving utterance or expression
2. the act of making your thoughts, feelings, etc., known by speech, writing, or some other method : the act of expressing something
3. an act, process, or instance of representing in a medium (such as words)
4. something that manifests, embodies, or symbolizes something else

# 4. the self

# 5. intelligence

# 6. consiousness

# 7. coginitive bias

# 8. defense mechanism

# 9. reality

# 10. truth

# 11. definition

# 12. relationship

# 13. Object

# 14. Language

# 15. observation

# 16. Analysis

# 17. heuristics

# 18. irrationality

# 19. probing

## In a certain subject, there are:
1. objects
2. relationships
complete knowledge is the awareness of ALL objects in the subject space and being aware of the ALL the possible relationships between those objects (understanding).
when you have complete knowledge of a certain subject, success in doing anything becomes a matter of accessing that knowledge and performing the task. failure is no longer there because enough lessons have been learned from the mistakes done and there's nothing more to learn.

Think of it this way, if you have the complete manual of a certain device, and it happens to be exhaustive of everything there to know about the device. This means that you have the entirety of the maker's knowledge there and you can use that without fail.
But, if you didn't have the manual, you're now tasked with creating that manual if you want to reach the complete body of knowledge.

*In this book, we're going to be taking the approach of fully grasping the subject space of our brains and the subject if intelligence. if the brain is our tool in gaining knowledge, we must know the best ways to use it and what mistakes it can do.*

*we're also going to chase after proper definitions of the self and conciousness, since they play a big part in the equation*

*the inner higher intelligence know yourself by listening closely and talking to yourself*

*mistakes are like a board of critics that scrutinize you*

*mistakes can be a sharp critic if you take them to criticize your own sense of judgement. Meaning that mistakes can make you doubt your own judgement of things*

# Methods of collecting information
1. asking the right questions
2. probing (subjecting the matter to numerous stimuli to try and understand their behaviour)
3. research
4. making mistakes
5. observing

*survivorship bias: the graveyard also includes the huge number of failed attemps the star has made and learned from to reach where he is at now.*

# what is needed to be discerning?
1. knowing the important parts of the equation

*mistakes show us the lack in our knowledge*

# a master holds an original copy of the entire field of knowledge. with every object completely uncovered when it comes to its attributes and functions along with all the correct relationships between objects. He knows the entire space with the very intricate ins and outs.
