# What is a critical thinking test?
Critical reasoning tests, also known as critical thinking tests, are psychometric tests commonly used in graduate, professional and managerial recruitment. These high-level analytical test are most commonly encountered in the legal sector, but other organisations such as the Bank of England also use them as part of their selection process. This test may be pencil and paper or it may be administered online depending on the format and the structure of the recruitment process. The questions will be multiple choice format and will usually be administered under time constraints

Critical thinking can be defined as ‘the ability to consider a range of information derived from many different sources, to process this information in a creative and logical manner, challenging it, analysing it and arriving at considered conclusions which can be defended and justified’ (Moon, 2008). If we lack critical thinking skills, it is possible to be misguided into believing that an argument is strong, when in actual fact there is little evidence to support it. Critical thinking skills therefore include the ability to structure a sound, solid argument, to analyse and synthesise available information, and to make assumptions and inferences. Critical thinking skills are also about being able to evaluate the information and draw conclusions that can be supported.

- Analysing Arguments
- Assumptions
- Deductions
- Inferences
- Interpreting Information

- Trailing off: Articulation is starting strong and ending the same way. Trailing off shows that you are unsure of your ideas
