# Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is concerned with enabling computers to interpret,
- analyze,
- **AND** approximate the generation of human speech.
Typically,
- this would refer to tasks such as generating responses to questions,
- translating languages,
- identifying languages,
- summarizing documents,
- *understanding* the sentiment of text,
- spell checking,
- speech recognition,
- **AND** many other tasks.
The field is at the intersection of linguistics,
- AI,
- **AND** computer science.

# Language Models

Language models are probabilistic machine models of language used for NLP comprehension tasks.
They *learn*  a probability of word occurrence over a sequence of words **AND** use it to estimate the relative likelihood of different phrases.
This is useful in many applications,
- such as speech recognition,
- optical character recognition,
- handwriting recognition,
- machine translation,
- spelling correction,
- **AND** many other applications.
