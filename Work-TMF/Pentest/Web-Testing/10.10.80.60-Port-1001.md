# what we know?
1. upload works with anything
2. upload adds (UUID) value to anything and place it in:
`c:\windows\system32\inetsrv\test(220e54fb-210c-42b2-9db7-93d74f47dcb9).ODT`
3. we get this JSON error after upload
`{"result":{"result":"ERROR","details":"Access to the path 'c:\windows\system32\inetsrv\test(220e54fb-210c-42b2-9db7-93d74f47dcb9).ODT' is denied."}}`
4. we have two aspx files in http://10.10.80.60:1001/uploads/
	1. uploaddocument.aspx (no parameters detected) --> param `source` seems to be there
	2. getfile.aspx (fileid parameter detected by Arjun)

# what we want to do:
1. try to change destination of upload to somewhere permitted

# Questions:
1. what made the dev create a page that uploads to a restricted area?
